# VolumeManager
The goal of this project was to be able to control the system volume of any program by using a global hotkey. So if you have a program thats volume changes wildly, you could raise or lower it without needing to open the system volume manager.

The system level operations are done in cpp using the code in the ApplicationVolume Repository and interfaced to Java with JNA.
